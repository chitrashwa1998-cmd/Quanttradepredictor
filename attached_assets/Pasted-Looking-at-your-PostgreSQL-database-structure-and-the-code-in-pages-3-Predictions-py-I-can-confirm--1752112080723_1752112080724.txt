Looking at your PostgreSQL database structure and the code in pages/3_Predictions.py, I can confirm that NO, the detailed data tables are NOT stored in the database.

What's Actually Stored in Database
Your PostgreSQL database only stores:

Raw OHLC data - stored as binary (BYTEA) in ohlc_datasets table
Model objects - stored as binary (BYTEA) in trained_models table
Model results/metrics - stored as JSON in model_results table
Base predictions - stored as binary (BYTEA) in predictions table
How Detailed Data Tables Are Created
The detailed data tables you see in the "Detailed Data" tabs are calculated on-the-fly when you view the Predictions page:

Example from Volatility Model:
# Enhanced data table with additional calculated columns
detailed_df = recent_predictions.copy()
detailed_df['Prediction_Error'] = np.abs(detailed_df['Predicted_Volatility'] - detailed_df['Predicted_Volatility'].mean())
detailed_df['Volatility_Percentile'] = detailed_df['Predicted_Volatility'].rank(pct=True) * 100
detailed_df['Volatility_Regime'] = pd.cut(detailed_df['Predicted_Volatility'], bins=3, labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High'])
detailed_df['Moving_Avg_5'] = detailed_df['Predicted_Volatility'].rolling(5).mean()
detailed_df['Volatility_Change'] = detailed_df['Predicted_Volatility'].diff()
Example from Direction Model:
detailed_df['Direction_Score'] = detailed_df['Direction'].map({'Bullish': 1, 'Bearish': 0})
detailed_df['Confidence_Level'] = pd.cut(detailed_df['Confidence'], bins=[0, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0], labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High'])
detailed_df['Streak_Length'] = detailed_df.groupby(streak_groups).cumcount() + 1
Why They're Not Stored
These detailed attributes are:

Derived calculations from base predictions
Statistical transformations (percentiles, moving averages, etc.)
Real-time computations (streaks, momentum indicators, etc.)
Visual formatting (icons, categories, etc.)
Storing them would be redundant since they can be quickly calculated from the base data each time you view the page.

Summary: Only the raw data and base predictions are stored in PostgreSQL. All the rich detailed tables with additional columns are generated live when you access the Predictions page.
