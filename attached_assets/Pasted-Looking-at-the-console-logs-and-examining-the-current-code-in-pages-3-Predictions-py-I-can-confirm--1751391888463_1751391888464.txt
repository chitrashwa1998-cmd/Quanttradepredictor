Looking at the console logs and examining the current code in pages/3_Predictions.py, I can confirm that fallback logic has NOT been completely removed.

Evidence from Console Logs
The console is still showing moment.js deprecation warnings for these synthetic values:

"Data_1"
"Point_181626"
"09:15:00" (time-only values)
These are being generated by remaining fallback logic in the prediction code.

Current Status Analysis
❌ Fallback Logic Still Active:

Synthetic date generation: The frontend is receiving "Data_1" values
Point-based numbering: Values like "Point_181626" are still being created
Time-only values: "09:15:00" strings without proper date context
Complex try-catch blocks: Still present in the code with multiple fallback scenarios
What's Still in the Code
Looking at the current pages/3_Predictions.py, I can see that while some sections use:

# Use authentic datetime from database
date_col = recent_prices_aligned.index.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
time_col = recent_prices_aligned.index.strftime('%H:%M:%S')
There are still sections with complex fallback logic that generate synthetic values when the simple approach fails.

Proof from Logs
The repeated moment.js warnings in the console logs are definitive proof that fallback logic is still executing and creating these problematic values:

"Data_1" - Sequential numbering fallback
"Point_181626" - Point-based fallback
"09:15:00" - Time-only fallback
Why This Matters
Since your PostgreSQL database is properly storing real datetime data (as confirmed by the console showing ✅ Restored datetime index: Date and ✅ Loaded 184125 rows from PostgreSQL with proper datetime index), these synthetic values should never be needed.

Answer: No, fallback logic has NOT been completely removed. The console warnings are clear evidence that synthetic datetime generation is still active and sending invalid values to the frontend, causing the moment.js deprecation warnings.

The ideal solution would be to use only the authentic datetime data from your PostgreSQL database throughout all prediction models, eliminating all fallback scenarios completely.
