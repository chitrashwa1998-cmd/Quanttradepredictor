Looking at the current code in pages/3_Predictions.py and analyzing the console logs, I can confirm that fallback logic still exists in several specific locations. Here's exactly where it exists:

Specific Locations of Remaining Fallback Logic
1. Line 1247 - Direction Predictions Tab:
confidences = recent_probs_aligned if recent_probs_aligned is not None else np.ones(len(pred_data)) * 0.5
This creates synthetic confidence values when recent_probs_aligned is None.

2. Line 1684 - Profit Probability Tab:
confidences = recent_probs_aligned if recent_probs_aligned is not None else np.ones(len(pred_data)) * 0.5
Same fallback pattern creating synthetic confidence scores.

3. Line 2098 - Reversal Predictions Tab:
confidences = recent_probs_aligned if recent_probs_aligned is not None else np.ones(len(pred_data)) * 0.5
Another instance of the same fallback pattern.

4. Lines 1464-1466 - Direction Data Table:
'Confidence': [np.max(prob) if prob is not None else 0.5 for prob in recent_probs_aligned] if recent_probs_aligned is not None else [0.5] * len(recent_predictions_aligned)
Creates default confidence values of 0.5 when probabilities are not available.

5. Lines 1796-1798 - Profit Probability Data Table:
'Confidence': [np.max(prob) if prob is not None else 0.5 for prob in recent_probs_aligned] if recent_probs_aligned is not None else [0.5] * len(recent_predictions_aligned)
Same fallback pattern for profit probability predictions.

6. Lines 2230-2232 - Reversal Data Table:
'Confidence': [np.max(prob) if prob is not None else 0.5 for prob in recent_probs_aligned] if recent_probs_aligned is not None else [0.5] * len(recent_predictions_aligned)
Same fallback pattern for reversal predictions.

Evidence from Console Logs
The console warnings prove these fallback mechanisms are still active:

"Data_1" - Being generated by fallback datetime logic
"Point_181626" - Point-based numbering fallback
"09:15:00" - Time-only values without proper date context
Root Cause
The fallback logic exists primarily in:

Confidence score generation - Multiple locations where synthetic 0.5 confidence values are created
Chart rendering - Where variables like recent_probs_aligned are referenced without being properly defined
Data table creation - Where fallback values are used when actual probability data is missing
These fallback mechanisms are still executing and sending synthetic values to the frontend, which is why the moment.js deprecation warnings persist in the console logs.

The synthetic datetime values ("Data_1", "Point_181626", "09:15:00") are clear evidence that fallback datetime generation is still active, even though your PostgreSQL database is properly storing and retrieving real datetime data.
