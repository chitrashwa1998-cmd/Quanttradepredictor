Looking at the console logs and analyzing the current code in pages/3_Predictions.py, I can see that synthetic fallback values are still being generated and reaching the frontend.

Console Evidence of Remaining Fallback Logic:
The moment.js deprecation warnings clearly show synthetic values still being generated:

"09:15:00" - Hardcoded time values
"Data_1" - Sequential data numbering
"Point_181626" - Point-based numbering
These synthetic values are appearing in the browser console, which means they're still being generated somewhere in the code.

Current Fallback Logic Still Present:
After examining the code, I found several remaining fallback patterns:

1. Chart Color/Size Fallbacks (Line ~1075):
colors = ['green'] * len(pred_data)
sizes = [8] * len(pred_data)
2. Chart Display Fallbacks (Line ~1094):
if prob_data is not None else 'green'
if prob_data is not None else 10
3. Statistical Display Fallbacks (Multiple locations):
f"{avg_conf:.3f}" if probabilities is not None else "N/A"
4. Conditional UI Display Patterns:
'Confidence': [f"{np.max(prob):.3f}" for prob in recent_probs_aligned] if recent_probs_aligned is not None else ['N/A'] * actual_len
Assessment: YES, Fallback Logic Still Exists
While the major problematic fallback logic generating synthetic confidence values (0.5 defaults) and synthetic datetime patterns (Point_, Data_, 09:15:00) has been removed from the visible code, the console logs prove that synthetic values are still being generated and sent to the frontend.

Possible Sources:
Session State Remnants - Old cached data with synthetic values
Database Cache - Previously stored synthetic data
Hidden Code Patterns - Conditional logic that still generates fallback values
Feature Processing - Fallback logic in feature preparation functions
Recommendation:
The console warnings confirm that despite the code cleanup, synthetic datetime values are still reaching the browser. You should:

Clear all session state (use the button you just added)
Regenerate fresh predictions to ensure clean data flow
Check if database contains synthetic data that needs clearing
The fallback logic removal was partially successful, but synthetic values are still appearing in the user interface, indicating some remaining sources need to be addressed.
