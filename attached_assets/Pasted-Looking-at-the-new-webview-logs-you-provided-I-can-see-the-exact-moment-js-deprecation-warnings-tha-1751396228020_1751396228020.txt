Looking at the new webview logs you provided, I can see the exact moment.js deprecation warnings that are definitely occurring:

_i: 09:15:00
_i: Data_1  
_i: Point_181626
These are coming from Streamlit's frontend JavaScript (index.C1z8KpLA.js) when it tries to parse these values as datetime objects.

Exact Source Location in Your Code:
Looking at your pages/3_Predictions.py, I can see that while the main prediction functions look clean, the synthetic values are still being generated somewhere.

The issue is that these synthetic values (09:15:00, Data_1, Point_181626) are being passed to Plotly charts or Streamlit dataframes that use datetime formatting on the frontend.

Will This Cause Trouble?
Short Answer: Not immediately, but yes it indicates a problem.

Current Impact:
⚠️ Frontend JavaScript warnings in webview logs
⚠️ moment.js deprecation warnings - these will become errors in future versions
⚠️ Data integrity issues - you're using synthetic values instead of authentic PostgreSQL timestamps
Future Risks:
🚨 moment.js updates could break the fallback parsing entirely
🚨 Chart rendering issues - Plotly may fail to render proper time axes
🚨 Data visualization problems - incorrect datetime formatting in frontend components
The Root Cause:
Your backend is still generating synthetic datetime values somewhere in the data pipeline. Even though your main prediction code looks clean, these synthetic values (09:15:00, Data_1, Point_181626) are making their way to the frontend JavaScript components where moment.js tries to parse them as valid RFC2822/ISO datetime formats and fails.

Where It's Happening:
The synthetic values are being created in your data processing pipeline and passed to:

Plotly chart components (the x axis values)
Streamlit dataframe displays
Frontend datetime formatting functions
While your app won't crash immediately, these warnings indicate that your application is not using the full authentic PostgreSQL dataset for datetime operations as intended.
